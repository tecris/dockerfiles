machine A - 192.168.1.72
libvirt net - 192.168.122.*

machine B - 192.168.1.73
libvirt net - 192.168.123.*

Configuration to allow external machines to connect to guests.

1) Configure virtual switch

 1.1) edit configuration
  # virsh net-edit default
    1.1.1) use Routed mode (on each machine)

      change forward mode from nat(default mode) to route
      <forward mode='nat'/>
      becomes
      <forward mode='route'/>
    
    1.1.2) on machine B edit subnet to 192.168.123
  
 1.2) stop network:
  # virsh net-destroy default

 1.3) start network:
  # virsh net-start default


2) Add routes in the physical network (this is required as no other hosts know about the subnet created by virtual switch)
  2.1) add routes that subnet 192.168.122.* can reach 192.168.123.* and vice-versa.
    http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/04/route-examples/

    $ sudo route add -net 192.168.122.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.72
    all the packets addressed to 192.168.122.* network will be forwarded via the 192.168.1.72 interface, which then delivers the packets to the addressed machine.

    $ sudo route add -net 192.168.123.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 gw 192.168.1.73
    all the packets addressed to 192.168.123.* network will be forwarded via the 192.168.1.73 interface, which then delivers the packets to the addressed machine.

  2.1) add routes that both subnet 192.168.12[2,3].* can reach outside. These routes had to be added in the gateway used to go outside.
